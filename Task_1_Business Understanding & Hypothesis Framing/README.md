# Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing
### Understanding the business context and problem statement.

##### Your first task today is to understand what is going on with the client and to think about how you would approach this problem and test the specific hypothesis.

##### You must formulate the hypothesis as a data science problem and lay out the major steps needed to test this hypothesis. Communicate your thoughts and findings in an email to your AD, focusing on the data that you would need from the client and the analytical models you would use to test such a hypothesis.

##### We would suggest spending no more than one hour on this task.

####### Please note, there are multiple ways to approach the task and that the model answer is just one way to do it.

If you are stuck: 

Remember what the key factors are for a customer deciding to stay with or switch providers
Think of data sources and fields that could be used to explore the contribution of various factors to a customer’s possible action 
Ideally, what would a data frame of your choice look like – what should each column and row represent? 
What kind of exploratory analyses on the relevant fields can give more insights about the customer's churn behavior?
